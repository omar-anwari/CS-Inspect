# CS Inspect Tool
This is my bummy 3D inspect tool. You can input throw in an inspect link and see the skin with info about the float, pattern, stickers, keychain, etc. Made this using Three.js for the model rendering and react and typescript for the UI and other stuff.

## Features
- Inspect skins using inspect links
- Ok UI
- Can use your phone

## Tech Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- Three.js (via @react-three/fiber)
- Float's Inspect tool (https://github.com/csfloat/inspect/)
- CSS Modules

## Broken
- [x] I broke textures again
  - It's sort of working, need to fix masks, colours, etc
- [ ] Gotta figure out stickers
- [ ] Figure out how to simulate float
- [ ] Figure out how to replicate patterns
- [ ] Figure out how to rip directly from the game

## Getting Started
Clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the development server:
```sh
npm  install
npm  start
```
